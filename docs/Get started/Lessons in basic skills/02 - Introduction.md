# 02 - Introduction

You will use GenevaERS to create **solutions**, where each solution is a <u>batch process that produces a large number of results with a short run time </u>, like the demo of this product.

You prepare each solution as follows:
1.  Plan what the solution will achieve.
1.  Tell our product what to do in the **Workbench**.
1.  Prepare **JCL for the batch stream** for the solution.
1.  **Run the batch stream for the solution** to get the results.

It sounds simple but there is a lot of complexity to this product, especially in how tell the workbench what work needs to be done.  The basic skills are about how the batch stream works and how to specify that work in the workbench.
