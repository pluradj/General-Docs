# B01 - Lesson B - START HERE

The report in Lesson A was almost useless because the report only has "customer number".  In this solution we access the Customer file so that the report displays "customer name".  The technique used is a "lookup path" which is often called "lookup" for short.  Lookup paths are one of the key speed features of this product.

Lesson B consists of these topics:

- Topic [B02 - Lookup paths](B02 - Lookup paths).  
  We need a feature called "lookup paths".  
- Topic [B03 - Define a lookup path](B03 - Define a lookup path)  
  Define a lookup path for the report in the workbench.
