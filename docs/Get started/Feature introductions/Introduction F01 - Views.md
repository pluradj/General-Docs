#  What is a view?
A view is how you tell our product the processing you require to be done.
You create a view in the "workbench" part of our product.  It is called a view because the main part of a view is a like a spreadsheet - you define the output fields and the input source and calculations or whatever it is you need done.

# What happens to a view?
1.  Workbench creates a view and other informatioin.  All this information is called metadata.
1.   Start phase - creates ??
1.  Reference phase - the view reads the relevant files once and creates working files.
1.  Extract phase - reads the working files and creates your results.
1.  Format phase (optional) - may further improve your results.


#  What can a view do for you?
Anything you need.  The usual tasks are:
1.  Access data in reference files.  For example, use a customer key to access customer details.
1.  Update files
1.  Create reports
1.  Whatever mainframe processing you require.  For example a SQL query can be done in a view.
